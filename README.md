# insta-*what*!?

Coaching + learning new React concepts through an Instagram-like web client for Mastodon. Probably not going to take Instagram down any time soon, but it's worth a try, right?

Proof of concept and no longer in development.

## Why?

[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) is a decentralized, federated social media platform that has a lot of potential. During an Instagram boycott earlier this year, @stordahl and I decided to address one of the most common complaints we'd heard about the platform: lack of familiarity.

## Features
- A beautiful, smooth, Instagram-esque UI that works great on mobile and desktop alike
- Ability to add multiple accounts and switch between them easily
- Virtualized timelines with endless scrolling, support for text posts, photos (w/ albums), videos, and audio
- A text post renderer similar to Instagram's stories (large font on a gradient background)
- Support for composing posts, content warnings, favorites, bookmarks, and other Mastodon features
